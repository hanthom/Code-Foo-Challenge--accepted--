Question Number 2: 

To be honest, I've never worked with web design stuff outside of fiddling around with Wix and things along that nature.  So hopefully my following answers aren't too comical in your eyes.

The first I could come up with would be 192 x 108 pixels, by simply multiplying the ratio by your 12 pixel increments.  Using this logic, it would also lead me to posit 96 x 54 pixels as a smaller picture, and 384 x 216 pixels.

1) 96 x 54 pixels
2) 192 x 108 pixels
3) 384 x 216 pixels
