Question 3: Knight question

	It depends on where the knight starts on the board.  Do to the ambiguous nature of the question, it could be in 64 moves, or more if the knight had to start in its actually starting position.  

I'm going to take it from the aspect of starting it anywhere on the board, in which case the total amount of moves is 64.
